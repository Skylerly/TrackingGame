It's like a Wii for someone who doesn't have a Wii!

Put any object you want in the box to use as your controller and use the arrow keys to shoot at the box!

![Game Demo](https://github.com/Skylerly/TrackingGame/blob/master/Demos/GameDemo.gif)

Features are extracted from your object and matched to every frame to find your controller.

Then we compute the homography to localize your controller.
